## Set

Two types set : Ordered Set, Unordered Set

### Ordered Set

- Contains unique elements
- Implemented using balanced BST
- Elements are sorted
- #include<set> header file
- Random access is not possible

### Unordered Set

- Contains unique elements
- Implemented using Hashing
- Elements are not in sorted order
- Random access is not possible
- Present in #include<unordered_set> header file
- Insertion: O(1)
- Deletion: O(1)

## Multi Set

- Can contain duplicates
- Implemented using balanced BST
- Elements are sorted
- #include<set> header file
- Random access is not possible

### Time Complexity in Ordered Set and Multi Set

- Insertion: O(logn)
- Deletion: O(logn)
