## Binary Search Tree


- Searching time complexity in a binary tree is O(n) but BST has a time complexity of O(logn)
- Left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key
- Right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key
- The left and right subtree each must also be a BST, there must be no duplicate nodes
