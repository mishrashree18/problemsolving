// Given an array representing n positions along a straight line. Find k (where k <= n) elements from the array such that the minimum distance between any two (consecutive points among the k points) is maximized.

// Examples :  

// Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 8, 4, 9}
//             k = 3
// Output : 3
// Largest minimum distance = 3
// 3 elements arranged at positions 1, 4 and 8, 
// Resulting in a minimum distance of 3

// Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 7, 5, 11, 12}
//              k = 3
// Output : 5
// Largest minimum distance = 5
// 3 elements arranged at positions 1, 7 and 12, 
// resulting in a minimum distance of 5 (between
// 7 and 12)
